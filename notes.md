### Notes

These are the Notes as I learn from creating this text editor:
- MAKEFILE
    - $(CC) : Not sure what this does yet still figure it out 
    - Wall  : stands for "**all Warnings**", and gets the compiler to 
             warn when it sees code in program that might not be techinally 
             wrong, but is considered bad practice and such.
    - Wextra and -pedantic : This turns on even more warning.
    - std=99 : This will specifies the exact version fo C language standard.
